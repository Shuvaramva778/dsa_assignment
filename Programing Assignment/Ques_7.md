# Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

## (a) Data Structure Definition
The weighted graph is represented using an adjacency matrix.  
Arrays are used to store distances and visited nodes.

## (b) Functions Implemented
The algorithm is implemented inside the `main()` function using standard Dijkstra logic.

## (c) main() Overview
The `main()` function reads the graph, source node, and computes shortest distances to all vertices.

## (d) Sample Output
0 -> 0  
1 -> 4  
2 -> 7  
3 -> 9
