# Undirected Graph Using Adjacency Matrix

## (a) Data Structure Definition
The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix.  
An array is used to keep track of visited nodes.

## (b) Functions Implemented
- `DFS(int v)` – Performs Depth First Search traversal.
- `BFS(int start)` – Performs Breadth First Search traversal.

## (c) main() Overview
The `main()` function reads the adjacency matrix and performs DFS and BFS starting from vertex 0.

## (d) Sample Output
DFS: 0 1 3 2  
BFS: 0 1 2 3
