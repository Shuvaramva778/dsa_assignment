# Min Heap and Max Heap Construction

## (a) Data Structure Definition
Heaps are implemented using arrays where parent and child relationships are maintained using indices.

## (b) Functions Implemented
- `heapifyMin()` – Maintains the min heap property.
- `heapifyMax()` – Maintains the max heap property.

## (c) main() Overview
The `main()` function builds both min heap and max heap from an unsorted array.

## (d) Sample Output
Min Heap: 1 4 3 10 5  
Max Heap: 10 5 3 4 1
